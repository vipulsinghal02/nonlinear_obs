## Nonlinear Observability and Identifiability


[Current draft](main.pdf), under construction

Notes on nonlinear controllability, observability, identifiability, and minimial realizations. This is the nonlinear analogue of the well known Kalman decomposition for linear state space systems. 

We also consider applications to biology--in particular, quantification of uncertainty in gene regulatory networks.
